Stealth Browser CLI with SKILLS

### Stealth Browser CLI vs Playwright MCP

This package provides CLI interface into Playwright. If you are using **coding agents**, that is the best fit.

- **CLI**: Modern **coding agents** increasingly favor CLI–based workflows exposed as SKILLs over MCP because CLI invocations are more token-efficient: they avoid loading large tool schemas and verbose accessibility trees into the model context, allowing agents to act through concise, purpose-built commands. This makes CLI + SKILLs better suited for high-throughput coding agents that must balance browser automation with large codebases, tests, and reasoning within limited context windows.

- **MCP**: MCP remains relevant for specialized agentic loops that benefit from persistent state, rich introspection, and iterative reasoning over page structure, such as exploratory automation, self-healing tests, or long-running autonomous workflows where maintaining continuous browser context outweighs token cost concerns. Learn more about [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp).

### Key Features

- **Token-efficient**. Does not force page data into LLM.

### Requirements
- Node.js 20 or newer
- Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or any other coding agent.

## Getting Started

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g stealth-browser-cli
stealth-browser-cli --help
```

### Installing skills

Claude Code, GitHub Copilot and others will use the locally installed skills.

```bash
stealth-browser-cli install --skills
```

### Skills-less operation

Point your agent at the CLI and let it cook. It'll read the skill off `stealth-browser-cli --help` on its own:

```
Test the "add todo" flow on https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc using stealth-browser-cli.
Check stealth-browser-cli --help for available commands.
```

## Demo

```
> Use playwright skills to test https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/.
  Take screenshots for all successful and failing scenarios.
```

Your agent will be running commands, but it does not mean you can't play with it manually:

```
stealth-browser-cli open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/ --headed
stealth-browser-cli type "Buy groceries"
stealth-browser-cli press Enter
stealth-browser-cli type "Water flowers"
stealth-browser-cli press Enter
stealth-browser-cli check e21
stealth-browser-cli check e35
stealth-browser-cli screenshot
```

## Headed operation

Stealth Browser CLI is headless by default. If you'd like to see the browser, pass `--headed` to `open`:

```bash
stealth-browser-cli open https://playwright.dev --headed
```

## Sessions

Stealth Browser CLI keeps the browser profile in memory by default. Your cookies and storage state
are preserved between CLI calls within the session, but lost when the browser closes. Use
`--persistent` to save the profile to disk for persistence across browser restarts.

You can use different instances of the browser for different projects with sessions. Pass `-s=` to
the invocation to talk to a specific browser.

```bash
stealth-browser-cli open https://playwright.dev
stealth-browser-cli -s=example open https://example.com --persistent
stealth-browser-cli list
```

For login-walled sites, keep a named persistent session so cookies survive browser restarts. After
finishing a manual login in headed mode, save a portable storage-state backup as well:

```bash
stealth-browser-cli -s=social open https://example.com/login --headed --persistent
# complete the login in the browser window, then:
stealth-browser-cli -s=social state-save auth.json
# later, reuse the persistent session or restore the backup with state-load auth.json
```

You can run your coding agent with the `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION` environment variable:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION=todo-app claude .
```

Or instruct it to prepend `-s=` to the calls.

Manage your sessions as follows:

```bash
stealth-browser-cli list                     # list all sessions
stealth-browser-cli close-all                # close all browsers
stealth-browser-cli kill-all                 # forcefully kill all browser processes
```

## Monitoring

Use `stealth-browser-cli show` to open a visual dashboard that lets you see and control all running
browser sessions. This is useful when your coding agents are running browser automation in the
background and you want to observe their progress or step in to help.

```bash
stealth-browser-cli show
```

The dashboard opens a window with two views:

- **Session grid** — shows all active sessions grouped by workspace, each with a live screencast
  preview, session name, current URL, and page title. Click any session to zoom in.
- **Session detail** — shows a live view of the selected session with a tab bar, navigation
  controls (back, forward, reload, address bar), and full remote control. Click into the viewport
  to take over mouse and keyboard input; press Escape to release.

From the grid you can also close running sessions or delete data for inactive ones.

```

### Open parameters

```bash
stealth-browser-cli open --browser=chrome    # use specific browser
stealth-browser-cli attach --extension=chrome # connect via Playwright Extension
stealth-browser-cli attach --cdp=chrome      # attach to running Chrome/Edge by channel
stealth-browser-cli attach --cdp=<url>       # attach via CDP endpoint
stealth-browser-cli detach                   # detach an attached session, leaves the external browser running
stealth-browser-cli open --persistent        # use persistent profile
stealth-browser-cli open --profile=<path>    # use custom profile directory
stealth-browser-cli open --config=file.json  # use config file
stealth-browser-cli close                    # close the browser
stealth-browser-cli delete-data              # delete user data for default session
```

CloakBrowser is the sole browser provider. It is selected by default; set
`PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_BROWSER_PROVIDER=cloakbrowser` explicitly (or omit it) for the same result. The
removed `patchright` and `camoufox` providers are rejected with a clear error. Explicit
`--browser`, `--config`, `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_BROWSER`, and `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG`
settings are respected and skip the automatic provider selection.

Every `open` reports the selected provider and installed provider version. Opening an already-running
session restarts it and re-evaluates the configured provider; `list` reports the provider name instead
of the generic browser channel, including for older sessions whose provider sidecar is missing. An
explicit `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_BROWSER_PROVIDER` takes precedence over conflicting upstream browser
environment variables.

### Structured output

Pass `--json` to any command for a deterministic response. Page commands return `ok`, `url`, `title`,
`result`, `console`, and `provider`. `provider` contains the active provider and version for managed
sessions and is `null` when provider selection was bypassed. Failures use the same schema, include an
`error`, and exit nonzero.

```json
{
  "provider": { "name": "cloakbrowser", "version": "0.5.3" }
}
```

```bash
stealth-browser-cli goto https://example.com --timeout=5 --json
stealth-browser-cli eval '() => document.title' --json
```

Use `eval --output=<file>` when the result is too large for terminal output. String results are written
literally, with real newlines and no JSON quoting; objects and other JSON values retain readable JSON.
The result link contains the absolute output path. Upstream-compatible `--filename=<file>` remains
available when a JSON-serialized file is desired.

### Snapshots

After each command, stealth-browser-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```bash
> stealth-browser-cli goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

You can also take a snapshot on demand using `stealth-browser-cli snapshot` command. All the options below can be combined as needed.

```bash
# default - save to a file with timestamp-based name
stealth-browser-cli snapshot

# save to file, use when snapshot is a part of the workflow result
stealth-browser-cli snapshot --filename=after-click.yaml

# return snapshot content inline (especially useful with --json)
stealth-browser-cli snapshot --inline --json

# snapshot an element instead of the whole page
stealth-browser-cli snapshot "#main"

# limit snapshot depth for efficiency, take a partial snapshot afterwards
stealth-browser-cli snapshot --depth=4
stealth-browser-cli snapshot e34

# include each element's bounding box as [box=x,y,width,height]
stealth-browser-cli snapshot --boxes
```

### Targeting elements

By default, use refs from the snapshot to interact with page elements.

```bash
# get snapshot with refs
stealth-browser-cli snapshot

# interact using a ref
stealth-browser-cli click e15
```

You can also use css selectors or Playwright locators.

```bash
# css selector
stealth-browser-cli click "#main > button.submit"

# role locator
stealth-browser-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"

# test id
stealth-browser-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

### Sessions

```bash
stealth-browser-cli -s=name <cmd>            # run command in named session
stealth-browser-cli -s=name close            # stop a named browser
stealth-browser-cli -s=name delete-data      # delete user data for named browser
stealth-browser-cli list                     # list all sessions
stealth-browser-cli close-all                # close all browsers
stealth-browser-cli kill-all                 # forcefully kill all browser processes
```

### Local installation

If global `stealth-browser-cli` command is not available, try a local version via `npx stealth-browser-cli`:

```bash
npx --no-install stealth-browser-cli --version
```

When local version is available, use `npx stealth-browser-cli` in all commands. Otherwise, install `stealth-browser-cli` as a global command:

```bash
npm install -g stealth-browser-cli
```

## Configuration file

The Stealth Browser CLI can be configured using a JSON configuration file. You can specify the configuration file using the `--config` command line option:

```bash
stealth-browser-cli --config path/to/config.json open example.com
```

Stealth Browser CLI will load config from `.playwright/cli.config.json` by default so that you did not need to specify it every time.
